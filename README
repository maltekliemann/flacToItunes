Usage:

  flacToItunes.py filenames...

Converts the specified FLAC files to WAVE, adds them to iTunes, set
metadata in iTunes according to metadata found in FLAC file. Finally
converts the WAVE in iTunes to Apple Lossless and removes the WAVE.

If some metadata field remains empty in iTunes, you may have to provide
a mapping from the name of the FLAC metadata tag to whatever name iTunes
uses for that field. You can do that by extending the `metadataMapping`
dictionary found at the beginning of the python script.
